           <li>Eiffel Tower, French Tour Eiffel, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. When the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted, and the Centennial Committee accepted that of the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel’s concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition on aesthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.</li>

Robert McAlpine & Sons was headed by Robert McAlpine, nicknamed "Concrete Bob" for his innovative use of mass concrete.oncrete was used due to the difficulty of working the hard schist in the area.McAlpine's son Robert, then aged 28, took charge of construction, with his younger son Malcolm appointed as assistant.</li>

It wasn’t glamorous, there was no cake, but there were spaghetti and eggs, which are the important food to be eaten on one’s birthday according to Chinese’s tradition. Our lunch at our guesthouse, Kalaafaanu Retreat, was a feast.At night, we had another feast at Green Leaf Restaurant. And there’s another story related to that dinner, which I’ll write in more details below.</p>

<p class="pt-5">On our third day in Hangnaameedhoo, we were walking around in the late afternoon, trying to find a restaurant. We decided to have dinner at Green Leaf Restaurant, so we placed our order at around 4.30pm and told them we would come back at 6pm to eat.
    At around 5.30pm, it started drizzling. We ran to Green Leaf to shelter ourselves from the rain. Our dinner was served at around 6pm. We joked with the waiter that we wanted to borrow umbrellas from him, but he said he couldn’t lend us.
    We ate while praying the rain would stop. After we finished our meal, we settled our bill and waited for around 30 minutes for the rain to subside, unfortunately, it didn’t. In fact, it grew heavier. There was no way we could run to our guesthouse without umbrellas, as I’m carrying a DSLR and all of us carry smartphones. Finally, the waiter lent us a huge umbrella, not two!

            The Grand Canyon itself measures 277 miles long, 18 miles wide, and 6,000 feet deep at its deepest point, though the park doesn’t even include the whole canyon.2 To put it in perspective, the drive from the North Rim Visitor Center to the South Rim Visitor Center in the park is around 200 miles and takes about four hours.</p>

            <p>Machu Picchu is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
                Amazingly, no wheels were used to transport heavy rocks for the construction of the city.
                Structures at Machu Picchu were built with a technique called &ldquo ashlar.” Stones are cut to fit together without mortar. Remarkably, not even a piece of paper can fit in between two stones.
                The citadel has two parts: Hanan and Urin according with the Inca tradition.
                In the Quechua native language, “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”
                Many of the stones that were used to build the city weighed more than 50 tons. How did these stones get up the mountain? Some were chiseled from the granite bedrock of the mountain ridge. For others, hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.
                On the Inca Trail, many porters sleep with a shiny metal object or mirror beneath them. They believe it sends away spirits coming up through the earth and whisks them away. Ask any guide or porter, and most will tell you that sometimes they have experienced the feeling of being pulled out of their tents by spirits of the past.</p>
